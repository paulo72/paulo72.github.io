It was \u00a3350 and I didn&#8217;t feel that I could justify the expense. I later came to feel that I had been shortsighted, and that I had missed the opportunity to learn from an expert whose perspective I admired.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve spent a good bit of time studying grid systems, read key books by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Grid-Systems-Graphic-Design-Typographers\/dp\/3721201450\/\">Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Making-Breaking-Grid-Layout-Workshop\/dp\/1592531253\/\">Timothy Samara<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Ordering-Disorder-Principles-Design-Interaction\/dp\/0321703537\/\">Khoi Vinh<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These books are great, however when I tried to apply what I had learned I had trouble with niggly edge cases and realised there were gaps in my understanding. I found workarounds but I have always had nagging doubts about them. So when I saw that Mark Boulton was presenting a workshop on grids at this years dConstruct I decided to take a risk. And I am so glad that I did.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being only a day long, a third of which seemed to be tea-breaks, I learned a lot. Many of the gaps in my knowledge have been filled and that I have a strong practical foundation to take my work forward in this area.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"work-and-critique\"><a href=\"#work-and-critique\" class=\"heading-link\"><i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\">#<\/i><\/a>Work and Critique<\/h2>\n<p>After a whistle-stop primer on the history, benefits, goals and challenges of implementing grids we got down to work. Most of the day was spent working on a layout task, putting together a web page using a compound grid.<\/p>\n<p>For most of us this was the first time that we had used a compound grid. While we worked Mark wandered around the room providing pointers and answering questions.<\/p>\n<p>There were two rounds of iteration and critique on the layouts. Initially I bottled putting any work forward for critique, noting that there was some serious design talent in the room. I realised however that the best bit of the day was the opportunity to to get peer review and critique from a room full of designers led by Mark Boulton. So, with a degree of trepidation, I put my work up for the second round of critique. And I am so glad that I did. Apart from being pleasantly surprised with the positive response, I got some useful critique about an aberrant pull-quote that had been bugging me and was able to quickly fix it as a result of the crit.<\/p>\n<p>The format was great: Fast-paced, practical and challenging. Critiquing a bunch of different solutions to the problem you spent the day trying to solve is a great way to consolidate your learning. It also proved to be a catalyst for Mark and the other designers in the room to share tips, tricks and solutions to common problems and niggly edge-cases.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A fast-paced and practical workshop on getting to grips with grids.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1129,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[36,37],"yst_prominent_words":[123,87,89,64,111,95,103,107,115,93,99],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1014"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1014"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1014\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1341,"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1014\/revisions\/1341"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1129"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1014"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1014"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1014"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/actino.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=1014"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
