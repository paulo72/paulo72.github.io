They were presented as a useful way to think about voice interactions and it occurred to me that they may have other useful applications for the work I do, primarily in writing help and instructional microcopy for the platform that I work on.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Grice was an academic, known for his work on the philosophy of meaning in language which has influenced the field of semantics. One of his areas of study was how the need to be cooperative shapes conversational norms. He summarises this in a collection of four maxims,\u00a0as follows.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quantity: provide an adequate amount of information, no more.<\/li>\n<li>Quality: ensure the information is accurate.<\/li>\n<li>Relation: provide information relevant to the matter at hand<\/li>\n<li>Manner: express information clearly and simply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"quantity\"><a href=\"#quantity\" class=\"heading-link\"><i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\">#<\/i><\/a>Quantity<\/h3>\n<p>An \u2018opportunity for\u00a0 improvement\u2019 in my own life.
